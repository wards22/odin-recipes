            <li>1 (10.5-ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup 4% small curd cottage cheese </li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, cubed and softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6), scrubbed and sliced into 1/8-inch thick slices</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>30 round buttery crackers, crushed (such as RitzÂ®)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cream of chicken soup, heavy whipping cream, cottage cheese, cream cheese, sour cream, salt, 
                garlic powder, and onion powder to a large saucepan over medium. 
                Cook, stirring often, until cream cheese mixture is melted, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove from heat; stir in thyme and pepper. Add potatoes and toss to coat fully.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Spoon half of the potato mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Using the back of a large spoon, 
                gently press down and spread potatoes in an even layer; sprinkle with 1 cup of the cheese. 
                Top with remaining potato mixture, gently pressing down and spreading potatoes in an even layer. 
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir together crackers, butter, and remaining 1 cup cheese in a small bowl until evenly coated; 
                sprinkle over potatoes. Transfer baking dish to a large-rimmed baking sheet. 
                Cover baking dish with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven, until the sauce thickens and potatoes are tender, 
                about 1 hour 40 minutes, removing aluminum foil after 1 hour 10 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Let stand 15 minutes before serving; garnish with thyme.
            </li>
        </ol>
