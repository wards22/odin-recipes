        <h4>Delicious Apple Fritter Cake Topped With Vanilla Icing</h4>
        <p>
            This apple fritter cake was inspired by the delicious flavor of a warm, cinnamon apple fritter. 
            The lightly spiced cake batter is baked with plenty of chopped tart apple on top, and then finished with vanilla icing. 
            Serve warm for best flavor and texture.
