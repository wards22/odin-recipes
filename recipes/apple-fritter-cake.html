        <h4>Delicious Apple Fritter Cake Topped With Vanilla Icing</h4>
        <p>
            This apple fritter cake was inspired by the delicious flavor of a warm, cinnamon apple fritter. 
            The lightly spiced cake batter is baked with plenty of chopped tart apple on top, and then finished with vanilla icing. 
            Serve warm for best flavor and texture.
        </p>

        <h4>Icing</h4>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place 1 cup unsalted butter into a light-colored medium saucepan. 
                Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until butter is browned, 6 to 8 minutes. 
                Pour browned butter into a large mixing bowl and allow to cool for 15 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine apples and lemon juice in a large bowl. Toss to coat. 
                Add in 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon and toss until thoroughly combined. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the cooled brown butter, add white sugar, remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar, salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg; whisk until combined. 
                Add in eggs and vanilla and whisk until thoroughly combined; whisk in sour cream and apple cider. 
                Add in flour, baking powder, and baking soda and stir until batter is mostly smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer. 
                Scatter apples and their accumulated juices evenly over the top of the batter. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean, 55 to 65 minutes. 
                Allow cake to cool for about 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make icing. Whisk together powdered sugar, salt, vanilla, and heavy cream until it is  a smooth, pourable consistency, adding more heavy cream if needed. 
                Pour icing over warm cake and smooth over the top to evenly coat. Serve cake warm.
