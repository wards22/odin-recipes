Start of Project:

The current project is titled 'Odin Recipes'.
I need to make a basic website filled with 
receipes to showcase what I have learned about
html so far.

After project completion:

The html stuff wasn't so bad. I felt a little slow with
Git in the command line, but got into a rhythm after a while.
